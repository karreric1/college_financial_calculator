# college_financial_calculator
A simple tool to calculate an ending balance (college fund) based on current balance, annual contribution, interest rate, and years of investment.

Development was started in the early winter of 2015 as a few lines of python code because I didn't have a scientific calculator handy.  Let's see where it goes from here....

As of 12/20/2015, some items I want to add:
1) Estimation of college tuition at the time of high school graduation, based on current tuition and average annual tuition increases.
2) A range of possible ending balances, based on market fluctuation and aggressiveness of investment
3) An interactive GUI interface - to "turn the knobs" and see what happens when variables are changed
